APE_to_AQS_GASEOUS

This python code takes audit files for gaseous data and collects the audit and indicated measurements, then outputs a pipe delimited text file called 'QA_output.txt' that can be directly uploaded to AQS.
This reduces the chances of human Typo mistakes, and improves the speed of uploading such files. This tool also has some sections for looking for mistakes in previously uploaded AQS data and fixing them.
During testing, several mistakes were identified and corrected, and a new set of 3 audits was uploaded to AQS in under a minute.


Getting Started
To get this program working you just need to save the python file to a computer that has a python IDE and a connection to the DAQ shared U: drive.

Prerequisites
I recommend anaconda/spyder as a python IDE, but choose whatever you want. This was built and works on python 3.7.

also need these modules in pyhton
python -comes with anaconda
pandas -comes with anaconda
numpy  -comes with anaconda
tkinter -comes with anaconda
os      -comes with anaconda
wx      -needs to be instaled, with the anaconda promt 'conda install -c anaconda wxpython', else  'pip install wxpython'

Usage example
1. Place the audit files you want to upload in your folder of choice. ie.g. U://PLAN/AMC/BCUBRICH/AUDITS/TODAYS_DATE 
2. Run this script
3. Select the folder where the files are with the dialog box , so in this case U://PLAN/AMC/BCUBRICH/AUDITS/TODAYS_DATE 
4. Code will run, then ask you to select output folder, I usually use the saem folder, i.e. U://PLAN/AMC/BCUBRICH/AUDITS/TODAYS_DATE 
5. Double check that the file 'QA_output.txt' has the same number of entries as files, and the the data are correct
     -This can also be done in the spyder IDE by looking at the dataframe 'output_df', which is easier to read that 'QA_output.txt'
6. Log in to the ENSC website and upload the file 'QA_output.txt'
7. Log in to AQS, navigate to Batch, and check that the upload occured succefully
8. As a final QC, you can query the uploaded data under AQS>Maintain>QA Assessments>Annual Performance Evaluation

Installing
1. Save the python '.py' file to your computer
2. Run it in python IDE
